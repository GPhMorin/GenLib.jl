Genealogical information for 140 individuals from the Quebec Reference Sample.

According to the R GENLIB documentation, `genea140` corresponds to
"a genealogical corpus made of 41523 individuals from the province
of Quebec, Canada. A total of 140 individuals have been sampled in
seven sub-populations, listed in pop140, and their genealogies
were reconstructed as far back as possible using the BALSAC population
register and the Early Quebec Population Register."
